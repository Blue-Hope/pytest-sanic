A pytest plugin for `Sanic <http://sanic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. It helps you to test your code asynchronously.

This plugin provides:

* very easy testing with async coroutines
* common and useful fixtures
* asynchronous fixture support
* test_client for Sanic application
* test_server for Sanic application


-----------
Quick Start
-----------

You don't have to load ``pytest-sanic`` explicitly. ``pytest`` will do it for you. Just write tests like,

.. code-block:: python

    async def test_sanic_db_find_by_id(app):
        """
        Let's assume that, in db we have,
            {
                "id": "123",
                "name": "Kobe Bryant",
                "team": "Lakers",
            }
        """
        doc = await app.db["players"].find_by_id("123")
        assert doc.name == "Kobe Bryant"
        assert doc.team == "Lakers"
